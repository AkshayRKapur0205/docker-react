Code Deployment System README

Overview
This README provides an overview of the code deployment system utilizing Docker, Travis CI, and AWS for automatic testing and deployment.

Components:
Docker: Docker is used for containerization, providing consistency across development, testing, and deployment environments.
Travis CI: Travis CI is utilized for continuous integration, automating the testing process whenever code changes are pushed to the master branch.
AWS: AWS is used for deployment, providing scalable infrastructure to host the application.
Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the code deployment system:

1. Docker Setup:
Ensure Docker is installed on your development machine.
Dockerize your application by creating a Dockerfile in the project root directory. Include all necessary dependencies and configurations.
Build a Docker image for your application using docker build -t <image_name> ..

2. Travis CI Setup:
Sign in to Travis CI with your GitHub account.
Enable the repository where your code is hosted.
Create a .travis.yml file in the project root directory to configure the CI process.
Configure Travis CI to build the Docker image and run tests on every push to the master branch.

3. AWS Deployment Setup:
Set up an AWS account if you haven't already.
Use AWS services like Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, or EC2 to deploy your Dockerized application.
Configure Travis CI to automatically deploy the application to AWS after successful testing.
Usage
Once the setup is complete, the code deployment system will automatically trigger the following workflow:

Push Code Changes: Push code changes to the master branch.
Travis CI Testing: Travis CI will detect the changes, pull the code, build the Docker image, and run tests.
Automatic Deployment: Upon successful testing, Travis CI will automatically deploy the Dockerized application to AWS.

Additional Notes
Ensure proper security measures are in place for AWS deployment, including IAM roles, security groups, and network configurations.
Monitor Travis CI builds and AWS deployments for any errors or issues.
Regularly update dependencies and configurations to maintain system stability and security.
